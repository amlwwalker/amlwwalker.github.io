## Alex Walker

I became conscious, in 1996 (I was not born then...) when I saw the web for the first time. I remember vividly thinking, 'What. Is. That.'. Before then, I don't really have full memories. That one is a whole story in my mind. Since then anything technology has fascinated me.

I reckon I was part of the last generation who typed computer games out from a magazine and had absolutely no idea why it didn't work. Give an 8 year old a break. I blame those sticky keys of the BBC Micro.

### Education

Fast forward 2011, I graduated with a master's in mechanical engineering. However a major part of that degree was solving problems using computers, Matlab specifically. Running simulations of engineering problems without having to actually build the thing? Now that seemed like the money shot to me.

* Embedded C Programming on arm devices
* Embedded sensor control
