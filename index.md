## Alex Walker

I became conscious, in 1996 (I was not born then...) when I saw the web for the first time. I remember vividly thinking, 'What. Is. That.'. Before then, I don't really have full memories. That one is a whole story in my mind. Since then anything technology has fascinated me.

I reckon I was part of the last generation who typed computer games out from a magazine and had absolutely no idea why it didn't work. Give an 8 year old a break. I blame those sticky keys of the BBC Micro.

### Experience

#### 2011-2014

For better or for worse, I started work as a software developer/analyst for a government defence contractor here in the UK.

* Software developer
* Data science/analyst
* Web interface design
* Penetration testing, internet security and encryption techniques
* Security analysis and research
* Automating tasks

- General tasks involved processing large amounts of data coming from multiple sources, syncing the data up so that the final dataset was discreet. Data would arrive asyncronously therefore it was necessary to minimise manual interaction. The final data could then be queried for anomalies and this could then go through further processing. The tools to do this did not exist and so everything had to be designed and built for the task at hand.

#### 2014-2016

* Head of security, [Decoded ltd](https://github.com/decodedCo)
* Sys administrator
* Dev ops
* Product developer
* Product designer (cyber security, software developer, data science)
* Data analytics content creation
* Business/technology overlap and spec design

- As the company was growing it was necessary to formalise a lot of the technology that was being used to run the business so that the business and its clients could scale efficiently and economically, however my main focus was on the security of the data and products the company offered.
- As part of this and working with their clients, it was necessary to understand business requirements and how technology could facilitate these.
- In general business suffer as a result of not having data in a format that allows for large amounts of the business to query it. Therefore often a business will struggle to utilise data science techniques because the data just can't be accessed. A lot of the work with clients at this stage was maturing their data pipeline.

##### Case Studies 2016 - present

- Internet security almost invariably relies on humans not making errors. On the one hand, this can be solved by automating as much of a task as possible but this can never be the sole solution. It is therefore necessary for employees to be educated in the ways in which cyber crime is committed. 
- The other side of the coin is to have confidence in the underlying resources (data) that an organisation relies on. If a breach is to occur (and it is a good mind set to assume it will) how can you be sure that data is trustworthy and hasn't been tampered with. Blockchain solutions, amongst others can be utilised to protect against data corruption.
- Supply chain financing is a beast like no other. Organisations in supply chains are not willing to give up who their clients are for fear of losing them. In some cases this means that some parts of a supply chain cannot gain credit notes against an order as the risk is to great. Blockchain can allow for supply chains to be verified without releasing information about other organisations in the chain. I consulted on a system to offer just this to an organisation that is currently using the solution in China.
- Micro financing, together with connectivity offer many incredible opportunities such as real time education in a one-2-many format that could not be realised without blockchain. The state transfer capability of a blockchain allows for transactions to be passed around but not completed until both parties are ready. This allows for a continual 'discussion' about the value of a transaction. In a sense, this is a negotiation that once a party agrees, they can not back out, however the other party can counter the negotiation at any time.
- Supply chain is often considered one of the most fraudulent economies around as it relies on multiple jurisdictions working together, that and the legacy systems of pen, paper and carbon copies. Blockchain allows for real time escrow to occur, between jurisdictions and in turn minimise the fraud and hold organisations accountable.

### Hire me for

##### Software/App/Startup development

* I love a new project, I love working out the design and detail. If you've got an idea, or need something worked on, let me know!

##### Security, Software, Technology, Blockchain consulting.

* Are you worried about GDPR?
* Are you wondering if your tech team are making your business' interests the priority
* Are you worried you are being sold down the river on yet another tech solution?
* Do you want to design a more secure work environment?
* Is security getting in the way of productivity?
* Do you need someone to setup you up with a seamless tech stack?
* Does blockchain seem like the answer but you can't quite see how it fits in
* Do you need to improve your blockchain vocabulary purely for your business needs?

##### Talks

I give talks on 

* Blockchain for business
* Data and how your business can benefit from it
* Technology and innovation. The two go hand in hand, but how to get it right
* Building an internal tech innovation team
	* Often culture can stifle innovation. I can guide you to building a team designed entirely to innovate

### Ask me about:

##### Programming

* Go, Python, R, Node(js), JS, HTML, CSS, Bash, Mongo, SQL, Docker, AWS, Solidity, QML, C
* Probably best to see my github or ask me directly for more detail
	* [File browser in Go](https://github.com/amlwwalker/Golang-File-Browser)
	* [Framework to build GUI desktop apps in Go and Qml](https://github.com/amlwwalker/got-qt)

##### Teaching/Talks

* I've been teaching technical topics for 4 years now to anyone from the (ex)head of MI5 to the (ex)head of M&S. I assume no knowledge. If you want to understand the buzz words, or want to become a professional programmer.

##### Tech consultant

* Tech should not rule your business. It should be a facilitator.
* Every tech decision should be a business decision. Non technical companies, still need websites. That comes with technical decisions to make. I aim to setup companies so that tech makes your life easier, it does not give you a headache.

##### Blockchain

* Develop blockchain DAPPS
* Invest in blockchain applications.
* Most importantly, when should you use blockchain?<br>Do you know if its the right choice? [Putting Iced Tea on the Blockchain is not the correct use of it](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/02/the-iced-tea-company-that-changed-its-name-to-include-blockchain-retracts-on-bitcoin-mining-operation/)

### Education

Fast forward 2011, I graduated with a master's in mechanical engineering. However a major part of that degree was solving problems using computers, Matlab specifically. Running simulations of engineering problems without having to actually build the thing? Now that seemed like the money shot to me.

* Embedded C Programming on arm devices
* Embedded sensor control
